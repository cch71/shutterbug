# ShutterBug

This was created in the early 2000s.

At the time I was working in an isolated building with no
windows and very sterile environment.  Being a nature
person, I created this project to use a logitech camera
to take a picture every x seconds and put it on my webserver
I then had an ActiveX object running on my desktop that
would poll the server and show the latest image.
